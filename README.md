This is a 6-Day-Software-Testing course offered by skill_lab for third year students.We gained hands-on experience on relevant concepts covered during the sessions. We have gone through Selenium,virtual environments,basic git commands and the importance of all the commands.We also got an understanding of how testing can be done.Had done tasks related to finding bugs in certain sources.On the final day we even designed and trained a Machine Learning model which performs Twitter Sentimental Analysis.The model was trained to classify the tweets as positive or negative.
